This is based on the project you get when you run `gridsome create new-project`.

Features added:

- Typescript Support in Vue Files (gridsome-plugin-typescript)
- ESLint and Prettier (ensuring compatible with Vue)
- Sanity config. Modify with required data sources as needed.
- To add sanity, use `sanity init` in project root.
